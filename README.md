In this repository there are sound files used in the experiment presented in: 

Peters Rit, Croijmans & Speed (unpublished). High-tempo and stinky: High arousing sound-odor congruence affects product memory

These sound files were downloaded from freesound.org licensed under creative commons. A total of 30 sounds were pretested, and the 8 scoring highest and 8 scoring lowest on arousal were selected to be used in the experiment.
